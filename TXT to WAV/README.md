# PCM to WAV Converter

This Python script converts a plain text file containing PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) audio samples into a valid WAV audio file.

## 📁 Project Structure

.
├── audio_data_26_11.txt # Input text file containing PCM values (one integer per line)
├── output_audio.wav # Output WAV file (generated by the script)
├── pcm_to_wav.py # Python script
└── README.md # This file


## 🧠 How It Works

The script performs the following steps:

1. Reads PCM values from a text file (`audio_data_26_11.txt`), where each line is a single 16-bit integer sample.
2. Converts the values into binary format using Python's `struct` module.
3. Writes the binary data into a mono-channel 16-bit WAV file using Python's built-in `wave` module.

## 🛠️ Requirements

This script only uses standard Python libraries, so no additional packages are required.

Tested with Python 3.x.

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Prepare Input File

Create a text file (e.g., `audio_data_26_11.txt`) with PCM values. Each line should contain one integer in the range `-32768` to `32767`.

Example:
0
-1234
5678
...


### 2. Run the Script

```bash
python3 pcm_to_wav.py

3. Output
After running, a WAV file (e.g., output_audio.wav) will be created in the same directory.

⚙️ Configuration
You can adjust the following parameters in the script:

input_text_file: Path to your PCM text file

output_wav_file: Desired output WAV file name

num_channels: 1 for mono, 2 for stereo

sample_rate: Sample rate in Hz (e.g., 44100 for CD quality)
